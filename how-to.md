Got it! You want to **push this to a new branch** within the same repo (letâ€™s call it `wiki-build`). 

Hereâ€™s how you can do that step by step:

### ðŸ›  **Steps to Push to a New Branch:**

1. **Create a new branch** in your local Git repository:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b wiki-build
   ```

2. **Add changes** (all files in your repo that have been modified):
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

3. **Commit the changes** with a meaningful message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Added Ukubona branding and refined homepage layout"
   ```

4. **Push the new branch** to your GitHub repo:
   ```bash
   git push origin wiki-build
   ```

   This will push your local `wiki-build` branch to your remote repo (on GitHub or whichever service you use).

5. **Create a Pull Request (PR)** on GitHub to merge the changes from `wiki-build` into `main` (or whichever branch you prefer).

### ðŸ”„ **Switching Between Branches:**

- To **switch to `main`** (or any other branch), use:
  ```bash
  git checkout main
  ```

- To **switch back to `wiki-build`**, use:
  ```bash
  git checkout wiki-build
  ```

---

### ðŸ’¡ **Final Tip:**

Make sure your **local repo is up to date** with the latest changes from `main` or whatever base branch youâ€™re working with, so there are no conflicts:
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout wiki-build
git rebase main
```

---

# ðŸš€ **Done!**
- Now your **Ukubona branding** will be in the `wiki-build` branch.
- You can continue working on it separately and **merge back into main** when youâ€™re satisfied.
